    InDesign is the favorite application I have learned in this class. This course helped me to learn many useful skills for my newspaper management and magazine editing classes. In this project I created a print layout that showcases the different class projects I have done so far. I made a postcard for each project. For the first postcard, I chose a vintage look.
