Intro
My Name is Amal Ben Ghanem. Iâ€™m a journalism student, and before that I was a radio journalist for 7 years. Visual Media Design 105 is one of the required classes that I have to accomplish in order to major in journalism at City college. I really enjoyed what we have studied during this semester in this class. I'm sure that some skills I have learned will be useful in my future career such as Adobe InDesign.

Photoshop
In this project I tried to use some skills that I learned in Photoshop. I started by taking two selfies with two different ways. One picture with a filter and another one without filter. Then I combined them in one piece in Photoshop and I added some types and colors.    

Illustrator
Adobe Illustrator is one of the favorite software I have enjoyed learning in this class.
Drawing has always been my favorite hobby since I was a child, and Adobe Illustrator was a discovery that helped me to transfer my drawing creations to digital designs.

Animate
The idea of this project was a kind witch who goes around to distribute some treats for children in Halloween.
In this project I didn't only use Adobe Animate but I got to use adobe Illustrator again to create the main character for this project.

InDesign
InDesign is the favorite application I have learned in this class. This course helped me to learn many useful skills for my newspaper management and magazine editing classes. In this project I created a print layout that showcases the different class projects I have done so far. I made a postcard for each project. For the first postcard, I chose a vintage look.
