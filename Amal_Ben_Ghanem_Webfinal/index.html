        My Name is Amal Ben Ghanem. I'm a journalism student, and before that I was a radio journalist for 7 years. Visual Media Design 105 is one of the required classes that I have to accomplish in order to major in journalism at City college. I really enjoyed what we have studied during this semester in this class. I'm sure that some skills I have learned will be useful in my future career such as Adobe InDesign.
